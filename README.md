## Providing-Apache-Web-Server-IaC2
Script for deploying a website running on top of apache server
###This script was inspired by https://github.com/denilsonbonatti/linux-projeto2-iac, its purpose is to update a server, and install the required tools
### to run a apache server and deliver a site to whom may access its http address.
### The site used in this example came from this repository https://github.com/LucasRBA/LabradorAdventures , in order to run this the labrador.html was
### renamed to index.html to make easier for apache to recognise it.
### The bash script was created using Ubuntu-server 22.04, running as a VM via Oracle VirtualBox, it was written using nano text editor version 6.
